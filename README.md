# Face Mask Detector
AI model of Mask Recognition Project conducted during the "Deep Learning" class offered by TÃ©lecom SudParis. 
The final model contains a real-time face mask detector using Tensorflow, Keras, and OpenCV with your webcam.

## Dataset
The dataset used is provided by Prajna Bhandary (https://github.com/prajnasb/). It contains 1376 images divided into with mask and without mask

## Image Classifier
- Built using the VGG16 CNN Architecture with layers added on top of the base model through transfer learning.
  
### Results
The following results were obtained using our model for artificially generated masks and real masks.

## Video Classifier
- Built using the MTCNN model for image finding on each frame, a scale-invariant method.

### Results
Below is a link to the video containing a live demonstration of the video results.
